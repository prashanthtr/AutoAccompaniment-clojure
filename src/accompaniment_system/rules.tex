;make single, double, triple susbstitutions for the

;same pattern,  and
;different patterns,

;come up with the weighting function
;( double taps are less weighted than other substitions in beat just before accented positions than in other positions)
;( double taps are less/equally weighted as other substitutions in last beat than in other positions)

;with the same set of substitutions

                                       ;what is the significance of the positions that the variations mostly occur in

; significance in the bar, significant in the groove, (loudness, accent, start, end, middle beat)

; based on position in the bar

(double taps are more weighted as other substitutions in last beat)

(first beat)
(1 double taps are less weighted in the first beat than in the 2nd)

(2 double taps is more weighted in the first beat than 1 double tap)

(3 double taps is equally weighted as 2 double taps in the first beat)

(second beat)

(symm pattern, same as sixth beat)
(1 double tap less weighted as 1 double in 1st)

(2 double tap same as weighted on 1st beat)

(3 double taps weighted more than 1st beat)


(third beat)

(symm pattern, same as 7th beat)

(1 double beat > 2 double beats > 3 double beats)

(1 double beat < other substitutions)

(fourth beat)

(1 double taps are eqaully weighted than other substitutions)

(2 double equal as other substitutions)

(3 double more than as other substitutions)

(fifth)

(symm pattern, rules are same as first beat)


(sixth beat)

(2 double tap more weighted than 1 double tap )

(1 double tap equal weighted to other substitutions)

(3 double tap same as 1 double tap)


(seventh beat)

(1 double tap is weighted more than other substitutions)

(2 double tap less weighted than 1 double tap but equal to other substitutions)


(eight beat)

(1 double taps are eqaully weighted than other substitutions)

(2 , 3 double taps not possible)


;based on the accent

(The beat following an accent is usually accepted for variation)

(typically there are 2, 3 4 accents in a bar)

when there are - (3-3-2), (2-3-3),(3-2-3) configurations are possible
when are 2 accents (4-4)
4 accents, (2-2-2-2)

;;playing single <1 double < 2 double< 3 double

(for every accents, there are beats before and after the accented beat)

;(on the accent beat that falls in the first position)

(1 double tap > 2, 3 double taps)

(2,3 double taps = single tap)

(on other accent beats)

(2,3 > 1 double tap > single subst)

(3 double taps > all other costs)

;(beat following the accent)

(1 double beat weight = single beat weight)

(2 double beats)

;(2 double beats can either end 1 or 2 beat before next accent )

(if they end 1 beat before next accent)
(2 double beat weight = 1 double beat weight)
:else (2 double beat weight > 3 double taps)

(3 double taps)

(if they end 1 beat before next accent)
(3 double beat weight = 1 double beat weight)
:else (3 double beat weight > 2 double taps)

;(beat before the accent)

(1 double beat weight = single beat weight)

( 2,3 double beat > far greater)



(2 double beat = 1 double beat only for 1st beat)


(double beat < triple in beat following accent)
